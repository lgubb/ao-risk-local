## Frontend public env vars (exposed to the browser)
# Development: call FastAPI directly
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000

# Production behind nginx reverse proxy (api served at /api)
# For Docker/nginx in this repo, you can keep:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=/api

# Or if you deploy API on a separate domain:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=https://api.ao-risk.example.com
